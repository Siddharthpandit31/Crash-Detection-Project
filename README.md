# Crash-Detection-Project
The development of the Automated Crash Detection System involved several key phases, each contributing to building a robust and accurate system. Below is a brief overview of the methodology:

->Data Collection and Preprocessing

Data Source: The HWID12 dataset from Kaggle was used, containing multi-sensor time-series data related to vehicular crashes.

Preprocessing: Handling missing data, normalization, and dimensionality reduction were performed to prepare the data for model training. Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were applied to reduce data complexity.

->Model Selection

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): LSTM networks were used for analyzing time-series sensor data to capture long-term dependencies.

RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks): RNNs were implemented to handle sequential data, specifically focusing on short-term dependencies.

VLM (Vision-Language Models): VLMs, combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transformers, were used for processing visual and textual data to detect crash scenarios.

Transformers: Transformers were employed to process multi-modal data, enabling more accurate crash detection through attention mechanisms.

->Model Training and Evaluation

Training: Models were trained using a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning techniques, with extensive hyperparameter tuning.

Evaluation: Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to evaluate the models. Cross-validation ensured that models were not overfitting and were generalizable.

->System Integration

Integration: The trained models were combined into a unified crash detection system that could process real-time data from multiple sources (sensors, cameras, etc.). Ensemble learning techniques were used to aggregate model predictions.

->Deployment

Deployment: The system was containerized using Docker for consistent deployment across different environments. It was tested with live data streams and fine-tuned to optimize performance under real-world conditions.

This brief methodology outlines the key steps in building the crash detection system, from data preprocessing to model training, integration, and deployment.
